This is Remark, a Language Evolution Simulator. Made in p5.js by Connor Trotter.

You can find all my code in the app folder. The docs folder is used for serving the webapp (although everything is technically the same)

You can visit and test the app for your self [here](http://ctrotter.co/remark/).
